What, you want to hear more about my music tastes?

Well, here's a couple of albums that I've had on rotation while coding up this website in particular. Stuff that's a bit more 'backgroundable', y'know, good for writing copy to.

- [Winter Tapes -  by nervous_testpilot](https://nervoustestpilot.co.uk/album/winter-tapes)
- [Neither Moon Nor Star - by Heosphoros](https://ptesquad.bandcamp.com/album/neither-moon-nor-star)
- [As If You're Never Hurt - by Slime Girls](https://slimegirls.bandcamp.com/album/as-if-youre-never-hurt)

I suppose you could call that the soundtrack to this website! But in the more general sense, here's some other stuff I've been jamming lately that I recommend:

- [Satisfaction - by Narrow Head](https://narrowheadtx.bandcamp.com/album/satisfaction) - just vibe with the grungy rock sound
- [Endless Fantasy - by Anamanaguchi](https://anamanaguchi.bandcamp.com/album/endless-fantasy) - blissful alt-rock chiptune combo
- [I Let It In And It Took Everything - by Loathe](https://sharptonerecords.bandcamp.com/album/loathe-i-let-it-in-and-it-took-everything) - amazing. Kinda like my favourite parts of Northlane and Deftones smooshed together.
- [Vacation Wasteland - by Slime Girls](https://slimegirls.bandcamp.com/album/vacation-wasteland-ep) - transports me to a world without care
- [Everything ever by City Girl](https://city-girl.bandcamp.com/) - essential lo-fi chill music
- [cryptoset - by littlescale](https://little-scale.bandcamp.com/album/cryptoset) - a wonderful 54-minute journey
