Not long after purchasing my first mechanical keyboard, I started to develop a minor obsession with collecting and customising keyboards. I've managed to collect a few of different sizes and colour schemes over the years, and I've managed to get some a couple nice photos of them as well, so here you go:

*(you may notice I often like to photograph keyboards in combination with aesthetically pleasing cans of drink. What can I say, I just think they're neat!)*
