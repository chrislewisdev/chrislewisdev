Although this talk lacks a recording, the content is based on my blog post [What It's Like To Work Through A Security Incident](/posts/what-its-like-to-work-through-a-security-incident/), so you can get all the goss there! I gave this talk at Sydney's Alt.NET meetup as well as DDD Sydney and Melbourne in 2019.
