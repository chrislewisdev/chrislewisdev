<p>This is a lightning talk I delivered at both LevelsConf and NDC Sydney in 2018. It takes a step back from the really
    big factors that impact your happiness at work, and focuses instead on the little things - using your keyboard as
    one example. This talk was a bunch of fun to write and deliver, particularly while I was still deep in the throes of
    mechanical keyboard obsession!</p>
