As much as I hate the phrase "quarantine hobby", I most certainly did take up a new hobby while stuck at home for much of 2020: skateboarding! It's nice to have an activity that doesn't involve staring at a screen for once, and although I'm no pro, I've been able to get reasonably comfortable on the board. I should put some clips here or something?
