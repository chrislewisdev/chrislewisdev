I unfortunately don't have a recording of this that I can share publicly, but this talk was focused around my quest to set up an IoT 'attention light' that my fiancÃ©e could use to get my attention whenever I was working ðŸ˜… The bulk of it came down to just using a standard neon heart lamp combined with an IoT plug to turn it on/off from their mobile, but I also explored how to control it from a small wireless IoT button as well. Come to think of it, I should really write up a blog post covering this some time...
