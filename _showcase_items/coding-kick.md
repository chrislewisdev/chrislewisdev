Coding Kick was my first major website project all the way back in 2011. I coded up my own haphazard blogging CMS wih PHP and MySQL, and to be honest to this day I am both surprised that I could be bothered to do that and also that it more-or-less worked!

I used the website to show off my various small game projects at the time and, like any young dude entering university, wrote blog posts about my opinions which I thought were far more interesting and novel than they actually were!

You can't access Coding Kick online anymore, and although I still have all the code and SQL data backed up somewhere, trust me when I say: you aren't missing out on much ðŸ˜›
