<p>Early in 2021 I started to take an interest in hobby Gameboy game development, and this talk shares some of my learnings as an introduction to what it's like making games for the Gameboy! It was just an internal talk done at my workplace but I snagged the Zoom recording and tidied it up for YouTube ðŸ™‚</p>
