# chrislewisdev

This is the repository for my personal website, featuring my personal blog, project showcase, and general information about me.

It's a static site built with Jekyll, currently hosted on Netlify at [chrislewis.dev](https://chrislewis.dev).

## Building

Most likely I'm the only person that will ever work on this site, but here you go anyway.

First, make sure you have Ruby and jekyll installed as per the [jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). Then, you can build and browse the website locally using:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

On every push to the main branch, Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy the latest version.
