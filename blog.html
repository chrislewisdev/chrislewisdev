<h1>Blog</h1>

<p>I don't blog all that often, but every now and then I'll find myself with the time/motivation to try and write something interesting. Take a look, maybe there'll even be something you'll enjoy!</p>

{% assign postsByYear = site.posts | group_by_exp: "post", "post.date | date: '%Y'" %}
{% for year in postsByYear %}

    <h2>{{ year.name }}</h2>

    {% for post in year.items %}
        <div class="post">
            <h3><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h3>
            <p>{{ post.description }}</p>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
