        <h2>Qualities</h2>
        <h3>Team Player</h3>
        <p>
        	Strong teams are crucial to real-world software development. I like working with and learning from others, and I have lead university teams of up to 9 others. 
        </p>
        <h3>Supportive</h3>
        <p>
        	Other people are at the forefront of my work. If I’m coding a new system, how will other programmers maintain it? 
        	For an API, what will best suit its user? These factors drive my design process.
        </p>
        <h3>Problem-Solver</h3>
        <p>
        	I love breaking problems down to an elegant solution. Object-oriented design is a second nature to me. I’m critical of my own code, spotting design problems as I go and considering their solutions.
        </p>
        <h3>Responsible</h3>
        <p>
        	I take pride in my work, and always aim to deliver to a high quality on any task. I’m not perfect, but I will own my mistakes, learn from them, and improve for the future.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p> 
        	I want to learn more about work environments with larger teams and their software development processes, in order to keep expanding my experience and understanding of software development.
        </p>
