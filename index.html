<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I'm a software developer living in Australia. Work-wise, I tend to find myself working in the land of full-stack development, typically using C# and React to build out product features for web-based systems. But really I'm interested in about any and all aspects of software development, and outside of work I'll just dabble in whatever takes my fancy.
</p>
<p>
    Truth be told, beyond that I'm not too sure what to tell you! But there's probably no better way to give you a feel for me as a person than just showing you some stuff that I've done or made. So check out a random selection of my showcase below, ranging from the new to the considerably not-new.
</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
var showcaseItems = [
{% for item in site.showcase_items %}
{
    title: `{{ item.title }}`,
    content: `{{ item.content }}`
},
{% endfor %}
];

window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    var spotlightItem = showcaseItems[Math.floor(Math.random() * showcaseItems.length)];
    document.getElementById('spotlight').innerHTML = `<h2>Random spotlight: ${spotlightItem.title}</h2><p>${spotlightItem.content}</p>`;
});
</script>

<div id="spotlight">
    <h2>Random spotlight</h2>
    <p>Loading...</p>
</div>
