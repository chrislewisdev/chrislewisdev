<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I'm a Software Developer living in Australia. 
</p>
<p>
    I'm fascinated with the greater picture of software development,
    especially the ebb and flow of projects from inception through iteration and final delivery!
</p>

<h2>Current Work</h2>
<p>
    I'm focused on full-stack development. Think .NET backends, MVC/JS frontends and the like. Then sprinkle in some DevOps too.
</p>
<p>
    We've been trying out cool new cloud-driven designs, but I wrangle my share of legacy code for sure!
</p>
